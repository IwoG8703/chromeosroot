# 📱 Root ChromeOS (FydeOS, Brunch Framework) – Complete Guide

Unlock the **full potential** of your ChromeOS-based system by rooting it with the help of **KernelSU**.  
This guide walks you through the process step-by-step — from downloading the patched kernel to installing it into your system.

Whether you're running **FydeOS** or using the **Brunch Framework**, you're in the right place.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> Rooting your device may void warranties, break system components, or lead to data loss. Proceed **at your own risk**.

## 🚀 What You’ll Need

🛠️ **System Requirements**  
- A Chromium OS setup (FydeOS, Brunch, or similar)  
- Developer Mode **enabled**  
- Terminal access (`Ctrl + Alt + T`)  
- GitHub account (for downloading kernel builds)

📁 **Tools / Files**  
- Prebuilt kernel (`bzImage`) from KernelSU GitHub Actions  
- Basic shell knowledge

---

## 🧩 Rooting Steps

### 🔽 1. Download the Prebuilt Kernel

1. Go to 👉 https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/actions/workflows/build-kernel-arcvm.yml?query=is%3Asuccess
2. Click the **latest successful** workflow (topmost ✅)
3. Scroll to the bottom and download the artifact:  
   kernel-ARCVM-x86_64-<version>.zip  
   > 📌 *Make sure you're signed into GitHub to access the download link.*

---

### 📦 2. Extract the Patched Kernel

- Open the archive and extract the file:  
  bzImage
- Move `bzImage` to your **Downloads** folder — this is the patched kernel we’ll install.

---

### 🧪 3. Install the Patched Kernel

Open the ChromeOS terminal:

```sh
Ctrl + Alt + T
```

Then enter the system shell:

```sh
shell
```

Switch to root:

```sh
sudo bash
```

Navigate to the Android subsystem's kernel directory:

```sh
cd /opt/google/vms/android
```

Remount root fs with r/w:

```sh
mount -o remount,rw /
```

(Optional) Back up the current kernel:

```sh
mv vmlinux vmlinux.orig
```

Copy the new kernel:

```sh
cp /home/chronos/user/Downloads/bzImage ./vmlinux
```

Reboot the system:

```sh
sudo reboot
```

## 🎉 Success!

If everything went well — **congrats!** 🥳 Your ChromeOS is now rooted via **KernelSU**.  
You now have enhanced permissions for apps, debugging, and modding.

## 💡 Tips & Notes

- 🔄 You can **restore** the original kernel anytime:
  ```sh
  mv vmlinux.orig vmlinux
  sudo reboot
  ```

- 🧯 If something breaks, try re-flashing your system.
- ⚙️ Consider pairing this root setup with **Magisk**, **ADB**, or **custom system images** for more power.
